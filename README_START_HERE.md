# 🔧 Quick Start Guide - Fix Strapi Deployment

## 🚨 The Problem
Your Strapi backend is failing to build in Docker with this error:
```
Error: Failed to load native binding
at Object.<anonymous> (/app/node_modules/@swc/core/binding.js:333:11)
```

## ✅ The Solution
Updated Dockerfile with multi-stage build to properly handle native dependencies.

## 🚀 3 Simple Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Upload Files to VPS

**Option A - Using PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
cd d:\dwilvins\Desktop\react-project\cde\backend
.\upload-to-vps.ps1
```

**Option B - Manual Upload:**
Upload these files to your VPS at `/root/gb-constructora-backend/`:
- `Dockerfile.backend` ⭐ **CRITICAL**
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.dockerignore`
- `quick-fix.sh`

### Step 2: Connect to VPS
```bash
ssh root@149.50.132.34
cd ~/gb-constructora-backend
```

### Step 3: Run the Fix
```bash
chmod +x quick-fix.sh
./quick-fix.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will:
- Clean old containers
- Rebuild with fixed Dockerfile
- Start services
- Verify everything is working

## ⏱️ Timeline

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Upload | 10 seconds | Files transferred to VPS |
| Clean | 30 seconds | Old containers removed |
| Build | 3-5 minutes | New image built |
| Start | 1 minute | Services starting |
| Verify | 10 seconds | Health checks |
| **TOTAL** | **~6 minutes** | ✅ **Deployment complete** |

---

## 🎯 Verify Success

After running the fix, you should see:

```bash
✅ Health check passed!
✅ Deployment process completed!
```

Test the API:
```bash
# From VPS
curl http://localhost:1337/_health

# From outside
curl http://149.50.132.34:1337/_health
```

Access admin panel:
```
http://149.50.132.34:1337/admin
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Still seeing errors?
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs strapi

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# Full restart
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

### Common Issues

**❌ "scp command not found" (Windows)**
- Install OpenSSH: Settings > Apps > Optional Features > Add OpenSSH Client
- Or use WinSCP to upload files manually

**❌ "Port 1337 already in use"**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
netstat -tuln | grep 1337

# Stop the process or change port in docker-compose.yml
```

**❌ "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"**
```bash
# Start Docker service
systemctl start docker
```

**❌ "Out of disk space"**
```bash
# Clean Docker
docker system prune -a --volumes -f
```

## 📋 Files Changed

### Critical (Must Upload):
- ✅ `Dockerfile.backend` - Multi-stage build fix
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Updated environment variables

### Helpful (Recommended):
- ✅ `.dockerignore` - Faster builds
- ✅ `quick-fix.sh` - Automated deployment

### Documentation (Optional):
- 📄 All `.md` files

## 💡 What Was Fixed

**Before:**
- Single-stage build
- Dependencies installed with wrong NODE_ENV
- Native bindings failed during build
- Build step failed ❌

**After:**
- Multi-stage build (builder + production)
- Proper NODE_ENV for each stage
- All dependencies available during build
- Clean production image
- Build succeeds ✅

**Key Changes:**
1. Separate build and runtime stages
2. Install ALL dependencies in build stage
3. Only copy production files to final image
4. Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for compatibility

---

## 🎓 Understanding the Fix

The error occurred because:
1. Strapi needs `@swc/core` to build the admin panel
2. `@swc/core` has native bindings (platform-specific)
3. Original Dockerfile installed production deps before build
4. Native modules were missing during build

The solution:
1. **Build stage**: Install ALL dependencies (including dev)
2. **Build**: Compile everything with all deps available
3. **Production stage**: Start fresh, only install runtime deps
4. **Copy**: Transfer built files from build stage

Result: Clean, reliable builds every time! ✅

## 📞 Support

If you're still stuck after trying the fix:

1. **Check logs**: `docker-compose logs strapi`
2. **Share output**: Copy the error messages
3. **Verify files**: Ensure all files were uploaded correctly
4. **Check resources**: `df -h` (disk), `free -m` (memory)

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Files uploaded to VPS
- [ ] `quick-fix.sh` executed
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Health check passes
- [ ] Admin panel accessible
- [ ] API responds

If all checked: **🎉 Congratulations! Your backend is live!**

---

## 🚀 After Deployment

1. **Create admin user** at `/admin`
2. **Configure content types** in Strapi admin
3. **Test API endpoints** from your frontend
4. **Set up backups** for PostgreSQL data
5. **Configure HTTPS** (recommended for production)
